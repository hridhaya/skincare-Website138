        <h1>Understanding Your Skin Type</h1>
        Welcome to our comprehensive guide on skin types! Understanding your
        skin type is the first step toward achieving healthy, radiant skin. By
        identifying your skin type, you can tailor your skincare routine to
        address its unique needs. Explore the different skin types below to find
        out which one best describes you. There are five primary types of skin:
        oily, dry, normal, combination, and sensitive. Each skin type has its
        own set of unique characteristics and needs that can affect the look and
        feel of your complexion. By first understanding what type of skin you
        have, you can begin to make informed decisions—giving your skin the
        customized care and protection it needs now and for years to come. If
        you're not sure what your skin type is, check<a href="#identify">
          Identify Your Skin Type</a
        >. We're covering all the basics about how to identify your skin type
        below, plus tips for choosing the ideal skincare products and routines
        for each type.

      <div class="contents">
        <h2>Normal Skin</h2>

        Normal skin is balanced—feeling neither too dry nor too oily. It is not
        prone to breakouts, flakiness, or feeling greasy or tight. People with
        normal skin typically have pores that are small, a smooth skin texture,
        and are less prone to sensitivity or blemishes. However, despite the
        fact that normal skin doesn't have any specific issues or concerns, it
        still requires proper skincare to look and feel its best. The ideal
        normal skin routine helps maintain your skin's hydration by locking in
        moisture and supporting your skin's protective barrier.

      <div class="contents">
        <h2>Oily Skin</h2>
        Oily skin produces an excess of sebum that causes the skin to appear
        shiny and feel greasy—especially throughout the T-zone (forehead, nose,
        and chin). People with oily skin may tend to have less wrinkles, but
        they may also be more prone to enlarged pores, acne blemishes,
        blackheads, and whiteheads.
      </div>
      <div class="contents">
        <h2>Dry Skin</h2>

        Dry skin generally produces less natural oils than other types of skin.
        This may cause it to appear dull and become rough, flaky, or even scaly.
        It often feels tight or less elastic, noticeably dehydrated, and may be
        prone to showing more visible fine lines. In addition, it may become
        itchy or irritated.
      </div>
      <div class="contents">
        <h2>Combination Skin</h2>

        Combination skin includes areas that are dry as well as oily—with the
        T-zone commonly being oily, and the cheeks being either dry or normal.
        This skin type can vary during different seasons of the year, and due to
        various factors, such as stress or hormone fluctuation. Effective
        cleansing and hydration are key to care for skin that's oily or normal
        in some places and dry in others. To learn more about crafting a daily
        regimen for combination skin, be sure to check out our CeraVe skincare
        routine for combination skin.

      <div class="contents">
        <h2>Sensitive Skin</h2>

        Sensitive skin is often referred to as a skin type, but it's possible to
        have oily sensitive skin, dry sensitive skin, or normal sensitive skin.
        Regardless of which type of skin you have, if you have sensitive skin,
        it may appear red and feel like it's burning, itching, or dry. These
        symptoms may be related to having skin that is more vulnerable to
        external irritants and may be triggered by certain ingredients—like dyes
        or fragrance—as well as environmental factors.

        <h2>Identify Your Skin Type</h2>
        If the above description didn't help you to understand what' syour skin
        type is, the these are the other ways to help you determine your skin
        type at home:
        <div class="contents">
          <b>1. "Watch & Wait" Method</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To start, wash your face with a gentle cleanser, then gently pat
              it dry.
            </li>
            <li>Wait 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>
              If your skin appears shiny throughout, you likely have oily skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              If it feels tight and is flaky or scaly, you likely have dry skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the shine is only in your T-zone, you probably have combination
              skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              If your skin feels hydrated and comfortable, but not oily, you
              likely have normal skin
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">
          <b>2.The blotting sheet method</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After washing your face with a gentle cleanser, pat it dry and
              wait for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Press blotting sheets to various areas of your face, then hold the
              sheets up to the light to see the oil markings.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the sheets soaked up an abundance of oil from all areas of the
              face, you have oily skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              If they absorb little to no oil, then you probably have dry skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the sheets show only a small amount of oil from your T-zone,
              you have combination skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you only see minimal oil from every area of your face, you most
              likely have normal skin.
            </li>
          </ul>
