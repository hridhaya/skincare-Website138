          <h3>Morning Routine: Balance and Refresh</h3>
          <b>1. Cleanse: Gentle Cleanser</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use a mild, balancing cleanser that removes excess oil without
              stripping dry areas. Look for a gel or cream cleanser suitable for
              combination skin.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>2. Tone: Hydrate & Balance</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apply a toner that hydrates and balances the skin. Ingredients
              like witch hazel or rose water can help control oil in the T-zone
              while soothing drier areas.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>3. Serum: Targeted Hydration</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use a lightweight serum with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic
              acid or niacinamide. This provides moisture to dry areas while
              balancing oil production.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>4. Eye Cream: Gentle Hydration</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apply a light, non-greasy eye cream to address any puffiness or
              dark circles without adding extra oil.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>5. Moisturize: Balanced Hydration</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Choose a moisturizer that offers balanced hydration, such as a
              gel-cream or oil-free formula. This helps maintain moisture
              without making oily areas greasy.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>6. Protect: Broad-Spectrum Sunscreen</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Finish with a broad-spectrum sunscreen (SPF 30+) that suits
              combination skin. Gel-based or lightweight sunscreens are ideal.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div class="contents">
          <h3>Evening Routine: Cleanse and Replenish</h3>

          <b>1. Cleanse: Thorough Cleanse</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use the same gentle cleanser to remove makeup, dirt, and excess
              oil from the day. Ensure it cleans both oily and dry areas
              effectively.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>2. Tone: Restore Balance</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reapply your balancing toner to help even out hydration levels and
              prepare your skin for the next steps.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>3. Serum: Repair & Balance</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apply a serum with hydrating and balancing ingredients, such as
              hyaluronic acid or niacinamide, to support skin repair and
              maintain moisture.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>4. Eye Cream: Nighttime Care</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use a lightweight eye cream to hydrate and address any concerns
              around the eyes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <b>5. Moisturize: Nighttime Hydration</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Finish with a moisturizer suitable for combination skin. A
              gel-cream or lightweight hydrating cream works well to nourish
              without overwhelming oily areas.

          <h3>Weekly Additions: Enhance Your Routine</h3>

          <b>Exfoliate: Balanced Exfoliation</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Exfoliate once or twice a week with a mild exfoliant, such as a
              chemical exfoliant containing glycolic acid or salicylic acid.
              This helps to smooth skin texture and address any clogged pores.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <b>Mask: Targeted Treatments</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Apply a mask once a week that targets your skin's specific needs.
              Use a clay mask in the T-zone to control oil and a hydrating mask
              on dry areas to boost moisture.

          <h3>Tips for Combination Skin Care</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Customize Your Routine: Focus on products that cater to different
              areas of your face, addressing both oily and dry zones.

              Avoid Over-Drying: Ensure your skincare routine doesn't over-dry
              your skin, which can lead to increased oil production in the
              T-zone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stay Consistent: Regular care and adjustments based on your skin's
              needs will help maintain a balanced complexion.
