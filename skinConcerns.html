          <h3>1. Acne</h3>
          <br />
          Symptoms: Acne appears as pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and cysts,
          often resulting in inflammation, redness, and potential scarring. It
          can occur on the face, back, chest, and shoulders.

          <h4>Solutions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Salicylic Acid: This BHA exfoliates inside the pores, helping to
              dissolve dead skin cells and sebum buildup, which prevents clogged
              pores and acne formation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Benzoyl Peroxide: Targets the bacteria that cause acne and helps
              to reduce excess oil, making it effective in treating and
              preventing breakouts.
            </li>
            <li>
              Retinoids: Promote cell turnover, helping to prevent clogged pores
              and reduce the appearance of existing acne. They also improve skin
              texture and can help fade acne scars.
            </li>
            <li>
              Niacinamide: Reduces inflammation and redness associated with acne
              while improving skin barrier function to help prevent future
              breakouts.

          </ul>
          <h4>Additional Tips:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Avoid Over-Cleansing: Too much washing can irritate the skin and
              worsen acne. Use a gentle cleanser twice daily.
            </li>
            <li>
              Non-Comedogenic Products: Choose skincare and makeup products that

            <li>
              Hyaluronic Acid: A powerful hydrating ingredient that attracts
              moisture from the environment and retains it within the skin,
              providing deep hydration and reducing the appearance of fine
              lines.
            </li>
            <li>

              Avoid Harsh Soaps: Choose mild, hydrating cleansers to avoid

            <li>
