      <h1>Understanding Skincare Actives</h1>

      Skincare actives are ingredients specifically formulated to deliver
      targeted benefits to your skin. They work on a cellular level to address
      various skin concerns such as aging, pigmentation, hydration, and acne.
      Here's a guide to some common skincare actives and their benefits:

          <li>

          <li>

            protects against environmental damage with its antioxidant
            properties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Best For: All skin types, especially those looking to improve
            radiance and reduce dark spots.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="contents">
        <h2>3. Retinol (Vitamin A)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Benefits: Stimulates collagen production, promotes cell turnover,
            and helps reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and acne.

        <h3>Tips for Using Skincare Actives</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Introduce Slowly: Start with one active ingredient at a time to see
            how your skin reacts, and gradually build up use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Layering: Apply actives in the order of thinnest to thickest
            consistency. Typically, serums and treatments go before
            moisturizers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Patch Test: Always patch-test new actives to avoid adverse
            reactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sun Protection: Many actives, especially exfoliants and retinoids,
            can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Use sunscreen daily.
          </li>
        </ul>
