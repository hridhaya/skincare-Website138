        <h3>Step 1: Determine Your Skin Type</h3>
        <p>
          Before diving into the routine, it's important to understand your skin
          type. This will help you choose the right products and achieve the
          best results.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Oily: Your skin often looks shiny, with visible pores and frequent
            breakouts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dry: Your skin feels tight, may flake, and tends to look dull.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combination: You have an oily T-zone (forehead, nose, chin) but dry
            or normal skin elsewhere.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sensitive: Your skin easily reacts to products, often becoming red
            or irritated.
          </li>

            Normal: Your skin is balanced, with a smooth texture and few issues.

        <h3>Step 3: Evening Skincare Routine</h3>

        <p>
          As the day winds down, your evening routine helps your skin recover
          and regenerate. 1. Cleanser: Double Cleanse: If you wear makeup, start
          with an oil-based cleanser followed by your regular cleanser. All Skin
          Types: Ensure your cleanser removes impurities without stripping your
          skin. 2. Toner: Choose Wisely: Whether hydrating or exfoliating, pick
          a toner that addresses your night-time skin needs. 3. Serum/Treatment:
          Night Treatments: Consider using retinol for anti-aging benefits or
          AHA/BHA for exfoliation, depending on your skin's tolerance. 4. Eye
          Cream: Target Concerns: Apply an eye cream to hydrate and reduce
          puffiness or dark circles. 5. Moisturizer/Night Cream: Richer Formula:
          A nourishing night cream will work overnight to repair and hydrate
          your skin.
