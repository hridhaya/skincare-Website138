          <b>1. Cleanse: Oil-Control Start</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Begin with a foaming or gel cleanser specifically formulated for
              oily skin. This will help remove excess oil and impurities without

          <ul>
            <li>
              Apply a toner with ingredients like witch hazel or salicylic acid.
              These help to balance oil production and minimize pores.

          <b>3. Serum: Hydrate & Control</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use a lightweight, oil-free serum with ingredients such as
              niacinamide or hyaluronic acid to provide hydration without adding
              extra oil.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="contents">

          <ul>
            <li>
              Apply a light, non-greasy eye cream to address puffiness or dark
              circles without contributing to oiliness.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Tips for Oily Skin Care</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Choose Non-Comedogenic Products: Ensure your skincare and makeup
              products are labeled as non-comedogenic to avoid clogged pores.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid Over-Cleansing: Cleansing too frequently can strip your skin
              and lead to increased oil production.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintain a Balanced Diet: Incorporate foods that help balance oil
              production, such as those rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
            </li>
